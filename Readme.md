## Project Description:

Hobby Lobby is a support system-based web application designed to help users exchange their hobbies. Users benefit by sharing knowledge about their passions while also gaining the opportunity to learn a new hobby from others. The platform promotes mental well-being, social interaction, and personal skill development.

Hobby Lobby connects individuals who share a similar hobby or wish to learn a new one. For example, one user may have expensive music equipment but lacks friends to play with, while another may want to learn music but cannot afford lessons. Hobby Lobby brings them together, allowing them to practice and exchange skills in a safe and structured environment.

The application will ensure that users are matched effectively, interactions are safe, and hobby exchanges are meaningful.
