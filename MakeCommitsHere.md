Scenario 

Dexter Morgan has always wanted to play the piano but did not want to waste money on lessons as they cost too much. 

 

He opens Hobby Lobby and selects “Music instruments” as the interest and photography as his skill that he can offer. He also adds that he likes reading books and has a full-time job so their meetings would have to be flexible. 

 

The app suggested a verified user called Brian Moser who does not have an issue with availability who shares book interests with Dexter Morgan wants to learn photography and could teach him how to play the guitar. 

 

Dexter messages Brian using the in-app chat and they agree to meet at a local park. 

After their session they both give each other a rating on the app and Dexter earns Hobby Points for getting a positive review. 

 

The following week Dexter gets another match on the app to now learn how to play the drums allowing him to learn more skills.
